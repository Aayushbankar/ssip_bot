OCEANSAT-3
EOS-06(Oceansat-3)also known as Earth Observing SatelliteEOS-06(Oceansat-3),was launched by PSLV-C54 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota on 26 November 2022.EOS-06(Oceansat-3)is developed to provide a unique opportunity for simultaneously measuring the physical, biological and atmospheric parameters for the first time from three instruments, (i) 13-band advanced Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-3), (ii) Ku-band Scatterometer (SCAT-3) and (ii) a 2-channel Sea Surface Temperature Monitor (SSTM). ARGOS is the fourth payload provided by French Space Agency (CNES) and serves as a data collection platform from various ocean based platform.EOS-06(Oceansat-3)is envisaged to provide continuity of operational services of Oceansat-1, 2 and SCATSAT-1 Mission with enhanced application potential.
